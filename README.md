## Facial_Emotion_Detection_CNN
## Deep_Learning - Convoulutional Neural Networks

The facial expression recognition system built in this project is a technology capable of
recognising the expression on a human face from a digital image or a database of faces,
and this can form the basis on which other actions can be performed.

The aim of this project is to use Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to
create a computer vision model that can accurately detect facial emotions. The model
should be able to perform multi-class classification on images of facial expressions, to
classify the expressions according to the associated emotion. 

**Objective: Detect facial expressions and classify whether ‘happy’, ‘sad’, ‘surprise’ or ‘neutral’.**
